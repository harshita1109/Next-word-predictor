              "'March 07, 2024\\nRemarks of President Joe Biden — State of the Union Address As Prepared for Delivery\\nHome\\nBriefing Room\\nSpeeches and Remarks\\nThe United States Capitol\\n\\n###\\n\\nGood evening. \\n\\nMr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Members of Congress. My Fellow Americans. \\n\\nIn January 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation. \\n\\nHe said, “I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.” \\n\\nHitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe. \\n\\nPresident Roosevelt’s purpose was to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary moment.   \\n\\nFreedom and democracy were under assault in the world. \\n\\nTonight I come to the same chamber to address the nation. \\n\\nNow it is we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. \\n\\nAnd yes, my purpose tonight is to both wake up this Congress, and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. \\n\\nNot since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today. \\n\\nWhat makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack, both at home and overseas, at the very same time. \\n\\nOverseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. \\n\\nIf anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you, he will not. \\n\\nBut Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is asking. They are not asking for American soldiers. \\n\\nIn fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine. And I am determined to keep it that way. \\n\\nBut now assistance for Ukraine is being blocked by those who want us to walk away from our leadership in the world. \\n\\nIt wasn’t that long ago when a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, thundered, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” \\n\\nNow, my predecessor, a former Republican President, tells Putin, “Do whatever the hell you want.” \\n\\nA former American President actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader. \\n\\nIt’s outrageous. It’s dangerous. It’s unacceptable. \\n\\nAmerica is a founding member of NATO the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War II to prevent war and keep the peace.  \\n\\nToday, we’ve made NATO stronger than ever. \\n\\nWe welcomed Finland to the Alliance last year, and just this morning, Sweden officially joined NATO, and their Prime Minister is here tonight. \\n\\nMr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever known. \\n\\nI say this to Congress: we must stand up to Putin. Send me the Bipartisan National Security Bill. \\n\\nHistory is watching. \\n\\nIf the United States walks away now, it will put Ukraine at risk. \\n\\nEurope at risk. The free world at risk, emboldening others who wish to do us harm. \\n \\n \\n\\nMy message to President Putin is simple.  \\n\\nWe will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down. \\n\\nHistory is watching, just like history watched three years ago on January 6th. \\n\\nInsurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy. \\n\\nMany of you were here on that darkest of days. \\n\\nWe all saw with our own eyes these insurrectionists were not patriots. \\n \\n\\nThey had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power and to overturn the will of the people. \\n\\nJanuary 6th and the lies about the 2020 election, and the plots to steal the election, posed the gravest threat to our democracy since the Civil War. \\n\\nBut they failed. America stood strong and democracy prevailed. \\n\\nBut we must be honest the threat remains and democracy must be defended. \\n\\nMy predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth of January 6th. \\n\\nI will not do that. \\n\\nThis is a moment to speak the truth and bury the lies. \\n\\nAnd here’s the simplest truth. You can’t love your country only when you win. \\n\\nAs I’ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask you all, without regard to party, to join together and defend our democracy! \\n\\nRemember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic. \\n\\nRespect free and fair elections! Restore trust in our institutions! And make clear –political violence  \\n\\nhas absolutely no place in America! \\n\\nHistory is watching. \\n\\nAnd history is watching another assault on freedom.  \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago tonight, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. \\n\\nShe scheduled treatments to have a second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. \\n\\nShe was told her dream would have to wait. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again. \\n\\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers! \\n\\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide! \\n\\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more. \\n\\nBut my predecessor came to office determined  \\n\\nto see Roe v. Wade overturned. \\n\\nHe’s the reason it was overturned. In fact, he brags about it. \\n\\nLook at the chaos that has resulted. \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother  \\n\\nfrom Dallas. \\n\\nWhen she became pregnant again, the fetus had a fatal condition. \\n\\nHer doctors told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. \\n\\nBecause Texas law banned abortion, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get the care she needed. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened as well. But it is happening to so many others. \\n\\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need. \\n\\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. \\n\\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next? \\n\\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without – \\n\\nelectoral or political power.” \\n\\nNo kidding. \\n\\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. \\n\\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom   \\n\\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024. \\n\\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again! \\n\\nAmerica cannot go back. I am here tonight to show the way forward. Because I know how far we’ve come. \\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. \\n\\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate. \\n\\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind. \\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. \\n\\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty. Any President owes the American people the duty to care. \\n\\nThat is unforgivable. \\n\\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. \\n\\nAnd we have. It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told. \\n\\nSo let’s tell that story here and now. \\n\\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind! \\n\\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer. \\n\\nTurning setback into comeback. \\n\\nThat’s America! \\n\\nI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world! \\n\\n15 million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record! \\n\\nUnemployment at 50-year lows. \\n\\nA record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope. \\n\\nWith historic job growth and small business growth for Black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans. \\n\\n800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. \\n\\nMore people have health insurance today than ever before. \\n\\nThe racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years. \\n\\nWages keep going up and inflation keeps coming down! \\n\\nInflation has dropped from 9% to 3% – the lowest in the world! \\n\\nAnd trending lower. \\n\\nAnd now instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs – right here in America where they belong! \\n \\n \\n\\nAnd the American people are beginning to feel it. \\n\\nConsumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring. \\n\\nBuy American has been the law of the land since the 1930s.  \\n \\n\\nPast administrations including my predecessor failed to Buy American. \\n\\nNot any more. \\n\\nOn my watch, federal projects like helping to build American roads bridges and highways will be made with American products built by American workers creating good-paying American jobs! \\n\\nThanks to my Chips and Science Act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic a shortage of semiconductor chips drove up prices for everything from cell phones to automobiles.  \\n\\nWell instead of having to import semiconductor chips, which America invented I might add, private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America! \\n\\nCreating tens of thousands of jobs many of them paying over $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree. \\n\\nIn fact my policies have attracted $650 Billion of private sector investments in clean energy and advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America! \\n\\nThanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced across your communities – modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, and public transit systems. \\n\\nRemoving poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of getting brain damage. \\n\\nProviding affordable high speed internet for every American no matter where you live. \\n\\nUrban, suburban, and rural communities — in red states and blue. \\n\\nRecord investments in tribal communities. \\n\\nBecause of my investments, family farms are better be able to stay in the family and children and grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living.  \\n\\nIt’s transformative.  \\n\\n \\nA great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years.  \\n \\n\\nBefore I came to office the plant was on its way to shutting down. \\n\\n \\nThousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading. \\n \\n\\nThen I was elected to office and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with the auto company knowing unions make all the difference. \\n\\nThe UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get those jobs back. And together, we succeeded! \\n\\nInstead of an auto factory shutting down an auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the art battery factory is being built to power those cars. \\n\\nInstead of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again! \\n\\nBecause instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union workers with higher wages will be building that future, in Belvidere, here in America! \\n\\nHere tonight is UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend, and a great labor leader. \\n\\nAnd Dawn Simms, a third generation UAW worker  in Belvidere. \\n\\nShawn, I was proud to be the first President in American history to walk a picket line. \\n\\nAnd today Dawn has a job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity. \\n\\nShowing once again, Wall Street didn’t build this country! \\n\\nThe middle class built this country! And unions built the middle class! \\n\\nWhen Americans get knocked down, we get back up! \\n\\nWe keep going! \\n\\nThat’s America! That’s you, the American people! \\n\\nIt’s because of you America is coming back!  \\n\\nIt’s because of you, our future is brighter! \\n\\nAnd it’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the State of our Union is strong and getting stronger!  \\n \\n\\nTonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together. \\n\\nA future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and biggest corporations no longer get all the breaks. \\n\\nI grew up in a home where not a lot trickled down on my Dad’s kitchen table. \\n\\nThat’s why I’m determined to turn things around so the middle class does well the poor have a way up and the wealthy still does well. \\n\\nWe all do well. \\n\\nAnd there’s more to do to make sure you’re feeling the benefits of all we’re doing. \\n\\nAmericans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere else. \\n\\nIt’s wrong and I’m ending it. \\n\\nWith a law I proposed and signed and not one Republican voted for we finally beat Big Pharma! \\n\\nInstead of paying $400 a month for insulin seniors with diabetes only have to pay $35 a month! \\n\\nAnd now I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it! \\n\\nFor years people have talked about it but I finally got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs just like the VA does for our veterans. \\n\\nThat’s not just saving seniors money. \\n\\nIt’s saving taxpayers money cutting the federal deficit by $160 Billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay exorbitant prices to Big Pharma. \\n\\nThis year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. \\n\\nNow it’s time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 drugs over the next decade. \\n\\nThat will not only save lives it will save taxpayers another $200 Billion! \\n\\nStarting next year that same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year even for expensive cancer drugs that can cost $10,000, $12,000, $15,000 a year. \\n\\nNow I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone! \\n\\nFolks Obamacare, known as the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. \\n\\nOver one hundred million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing conditions. \\n\\nBut my predecessor and many in this chamber want to take that protection away by repealing the Affordable Care Act I won’t let that happen! \\n\\nWe stopped you 50 times before and we will stop you again! \\n\\nIn fact I am protecting it and expanding it. \\n\\nI enacted tax credits that save $800 per person per year reducing health care premiums for millions of working families. \\n\\nThose tax credits expire next year. \\n\\nI want to make those savings permanent! \\n\\nWomen are more than half of our population but research on women’s health has always been underfunded.  \\n\\nThat’s why we’re launching the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, led by Jill who is doing an incredible job as First Lady. \\n\\nPass my plan for $12 Billion to transform women’s health research and benefit millions of lives across America! \\n\\nI know the cost of housing is so important to you.  \\n\\nIf inflation keeps coming down mortgage rates will come down as well. \\n\\nBut I’m not waiting. \\n\\nI want to provide an annual tax creditthat will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy a first home or trade up for a little more space. \\n\\nMy Administration is also eliminating title insurance fees for federally backed mortgages. \\n\\nWhen you refinance your home this can save you $1,000 or more. \\n\\nFor millions of renters, we’re cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents.  \\n\\nI’ve cut red tape so more builders can get federal financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million housing units nationwide. \\n\\nNow pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million  affordable homes and bring those rents down! \\n\\nTo remain the strongest economy in the world we need the best education system in the world. \\n\\nI want to give every child a good start by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds. \\n\\nStudies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree no matter their background. \\n\\nI want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning time and see to it that every child learns to read by third grade. \\n\\nI’m also connecting businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college. \\n\\nAnd I want to make college more affordable. \\n\\nLet’s continue increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families and increase our record investments in HBCUs and Hispanic and Minority-serving Institutions \\n\\nI fixed student loan programs to reduce the burden  of student debt for nearly 4 Million Americans including nurses firefighters and others in public service like Keenan Jones a public-school educator in Minnesota who’s here with us tonight. \\n\\nHe’s educated hundreds of students so they can go to college now he can help his own daughter pay for college.  \\n\\nSuch relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home start a business even start a family. \\n\\nWhile we’re at it I want to give public school teachers a raise! \\n\\nNow let me speak to a question of fundamental fairness for all Americans. \\n\\nI’ve been delivering real results in a fiscally responsible way. \\n\\nI’ve already cut the federal deficit by over one trillion dollars. \\n\\nI signed a bipartisan budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade. \\n\\nAnd now it’s my goal to cut the federal deficit $3 trillion more by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.  \\n\\nLook, I’m a capitalist. \\n\\nIf you want to make a million bucks – great! \\n\\nJust pay your fair share in taxes. \\n\\nA fair tax code is how we invest in the things –  \\n\\nthat make a country great, health care, education, defense, and more. \\n\\nBut here’s the deal. \\n\\nThe last administration enacted a $2 Trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal deficit. \\n\\nThey added more to the national debt than in any presidential term in American history. \\n\\nFor folks at home does anybody really think the tax code is fair? \\n\\nDo you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion in tax breaks? \\n\\nI sure don’t. I’m going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair! \\n\\nUnder my plan nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes. \\n\\nNobody. Not one penny. \\n\\nIn fact the Child Tax Credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in HALF. \\n\\nRestore the Child Tax Credit because no child should go hungry in this country! \\n\\nThe way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their share. \\n\\nIn 2020 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 Billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes.  \\n\\nNot any more! \\n\\nThanks to the law I wrote and signed big companies  now have to pay a minimum of 15%.  \\n\\nBut that’s still less than working people pay in federal taxes. \\n\\nIt’s time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21% so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share. \\n\\nI also want to end the tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, and massive executive pay! \\n\\nEnd it now! \\n\\nThere are 1,000 billionaires in America.  \\n\\nYou know what the average federal tax rate for these billionaires is? 8.2 percent! \\n\\nThat’s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay.  \\n\\nNo billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse! \\n\\nThat’s why I’ve proposed a minimum tax of 25% for billionaires. Just 25%. \\n\\nThat would raise $500 Billion over the next 10 years. \\n\\nImagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable child care so millions of families can get the care they need and still go to work and help grow the economy. \\n\\nImagine a future with paid leave because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of yourself or a sick family member.   \\n\\nImagine a future with home care and elder care so seniors and people living with disabilities can stay in their homes and family caregivers get paid what they deserve! \\n\\nTonight, let’s all agree once again to stand up for seniors! \\n\\nMany of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block.  \\n\\nIf anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them! \\n\\nWorking people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It’s not fair. \\n\\nWe have two ways to go on Social Security. \\n\\nRepublicans will cut Social Security and give more tax cuts to the wealthy. \\n\\nI will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share! \\n\\nToo many corporations raise their prices to pad their profits charging you more and more for less and less. \\n\\nThat’s why we’re cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging or deceptive pricing from food to health care to housing. \\n\\nIn fact, snack companies think you won’t notice when they charge you just as much for the same size bag  \\n\\nbut with fewer chips in it. \\n\\nPass Senator Bob Casey’s bill to put a stop to shrinkflation! \\n\\nI’m also getting rid of junk fees those hidden fees added at the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we’re cutting credit card late fees from $32 to just $8. \\n\\nThe banks and credit card companies don’t like it. \\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nI’m saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I’m eliminating. \\n\\nAnd I’m not stopping there. \\n\\nMy Administration has proposed rules to make cable travel utilities and online ticket sellers tell you the total price upfront so there are no surprises. \\n\\nIt matters. \\n\\nAnd so does this. \\n\\nIn November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators. \\n\\nThe result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we’ve ever seen  \\n\\nin this country. \\n\\nThat bipartisan deal would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers.  \\n\\n100 more immigration judges to help tackle a backload of 2 million cases. \\n\\n4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years. \\n\\n100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America. \\n\\nThis bill would save lives and bring order to the border. \\n\\nIt would also give me as President new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border  when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming.  \\n\\nThe Border Patrol Union endorsed the bill. \\n\\nThe Chamber of Commerce endorsed the bill. \\n\\nI believe that given the opportunity a majority of the House and Senate would endorse it as well. \\n\\nBut unfortunately, politics have derailed it so far. \\n\\nI’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him. \\n\\nIt’s not about him or me.  \\n\\nIt’d be a winner for America! \\n\\nMy Republican friends you owe it to the American people to get this bill done.   \\n\\nWe need to act. \\n\\nAnd if my predecessor is watching instead of playing politics and pressuring members of Congress to block this bill, join me in telling Congress to pass it! \\n\\nWe can do it together. But here’s what I will not do. \\n\\nI will not demonize immigrants saying they “poison the blood of our country” as he said in his own words. \\n\\nI will not separate families. \\n\\nI will not ban people from America because of their faith. \\n\\nUnlike my predecessor, on my first day in office I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure the border, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and so much more. \\n\\nBecause unlike my predecessor, I know who we are  \\n\\nas Americans. \\n\\nWe are the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new. \\n\\nHome to Native Americans whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years. Home to people from every place on Earth. \\n\\nSome came freely. \\n\\nSome chained by force. \\n\\nSome when famine struck, like my ancestral family in Ireland. \\n\\nSome to flee persecution. \\n\\nSome to chase dreams that are impossible anywhere but here in America. \\n\\nThat’s America, where we all come from somewhere, but we are all Americans. \\n\\nWe can fight about the border, or we can fix it. I’m ready to fix it. \\n\\nSend me the border bill now! \\n\\nA transformational moment in our history happened 59 years ago today in Selma, Alabama. \\n\\nHundreds of foot soldiers for justice marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after a Grand Dragon of the KKK, to claim their fundamental right to vote.  \\n\\nThey were beaten bloodied and left for dead. \\n\\nOur late friend and former colleague John Lewis was at the march.  \\n\\nWe miss him. \\n\\nJoining us tonight are other marchers who were there including Betty May Fikes, known as the “Voice of Selma”. \\n\\nA daughter of gospel singers and preachers, she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday, \\n\\nto help shake the nation’s conscience. Five months later, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.   \\n \\n\\nBut 59 years later, there are forces taking us back in time. \\n\\nVoter suppression. Election subversion. Unlimited dark money. Extreme gerrymandering.  \\n\\nJohn Lewis was a great friend to many of us here. But if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes who marched with him, then it’s time for more than just talk. \\n\\nPass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act! \\n\\nAnd stop denying another core value of America our diversity across American life. \\n\\nBanning books. \\n\\nIt’s wrong! \\n\\nInstead of erasing history, let’s make history!  \\n\\nI want to protect other fundamental rights! \\n\\nPass the Equality Act, and my message to transgender Americans: I have your back! \\n\\nPass the PRO Act for workers rights! And raise the federal minimum wage because every worker has the right to earn a decent living! \\n\\nWe are also making history by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. \\n\\nI’m taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world. \\n\\nI am cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030. \\n\\nCreating tens of thousands of clean-energy jobs, like the IBEW workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. \\n\\nConserving 30% of America’s lands and waters  by 2030. \\n\\nTaking historic action on environmental justice for fence-line communities smothered by the legacy of pollution.  \\n\\nAnd patterned after the Peace Corps and Ameri Corps, I’ve launched a Climate Corps to put 20,000 young people to work at the forefront of our clean energy future. \\n\\nI’ll triple that number this decade. \\n\\nAll Americans deserve the freedom to be safe, and America is safer today than when I took office. \\n\\nThe year before I took office, murders went up 30% nationwide the biggest increase in history. \\n\\nThat was then. \\n\\nNow, through my American Rescue Plan, which every Republican voted against, I’ve made the largest investment in public safety ever. \\n\\nLast year, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history, and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than 50 years.  \\n\\nBut we have more to do. \\n\\nHelp cities and towns invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, and more community violence intervention.  \\n\\nGive communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking. \\n\\nKeep building public trust, as I’ve been doing by taking executive action on police reform, and calling for it to be the law of the land, directing my Cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana, and expunging thousands of convictions  for mere possession, because no one should be jailed for using or possessing marijuana! \\n\\nTo take on crimes of domestic violence, I am ramping up federal enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act, that I proudly wrote, so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women in America!  \\n\\nAnd there’s another kind of violence I want to stop. \\n\\nWith us tonight is Jasmine, whose 9-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers at her elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. \\n\\nSoon after it happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde and spent hours with the families. \\n\\nWe heard their message, and so should everyone in this chamber do something. \\n\\nI did do something by establishing the first-ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the White House that Vice President Harris is leading. \\n\\nMeanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was President. \\n\\nAfter another school shooting in Iowa he said we should just “get over it.” \\n\\nI say we must stop it.  \\n\\nI’m proud we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years! \\n\\nNow we must beat the NRA again! \\n\\nI’m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines! \\n\\nPass universal background checks! \\n\\nNone of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners. \\n\\nAs we manage challenges at home, we’re also managing crises abroad including in the Middle East. \\n\\nI know the last five months have been gut-wrenching for so many people, for the Israeli people, the Palestinian people, and so many here in America. \\n\\nThis crisis began on October 7th with a massacre by the terrorist group Hamas. \\n\\n1,200 innocent people women and girls men and boys slaughtered, many enduring sexual violence. \\n\\nThe deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. \\n\\n250 hostages taken. \\n\\nHere in the chamber tonight are American families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas. \\n\\nI pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring their loved ones home. \\n\\nWe will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul, Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. \\n\\nIsrael has a right to go after Hamas. \\n\\nHamas could end this conflict today by releasing the hostages, laying down arms, and surrendering those responsible for October 7th. \\n\\nIsrael has an added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population. But Israel also has a fundamental responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Gaza. \\n\\nThis war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined. \\n\\nMore than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed. \\n\\nMost of whom are not Hamas. \\n\\nThousands and thousands are innocent women and children. \\n\\nGirls and boys also orphaned. \\n\\nNearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displaced. \\n\\nHomes destroyed, neighborhoods in rubble, cities in ruin. \\n\\nFamilies without food, water, medicine. \\n\\nIt’s heartbreaking. \\n\\nWe’ve been working non-stop to establish an immediate ceasefire that would last for at least six weeks. \\n\\nIt would get the hostages home, ease the intolerable humanitarian crisis, and build toward something more enduring. \\n\\nThe United States has been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza. \\n\\nTonight, I’m directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. \\n\\nNo U.S. boots will be on the ground. \\n\\nThis temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day. \\n\\nBut Israel must also do its part. \\n\\nIsrael must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure that humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the cross fire. \\n\\nTo the leadership of Israel I say this. \\n\\nHumanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. \\n\\nProtecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority. \\n\\nAs we look to the future, the only real solution is a two-state solution. \\n\\nI say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel and the only American president to visit Israel in wartime. \\n\\nThere is no other path that guarantees Israel’s security and democracy. \\n\\nThere is no other path that guarantees Palestinians can live with peace and dignity. \\n\\nThere is no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia.  \\n\\nCreating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran.  \\n\\nThat’s why I built a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. \\n\\nI’ve ordered strikes to degrade Houthi capabilities and defend U.S. Forces in the region. \\n\\nAs Commander in Chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and military personnel.  \\n\\nFor years, all I’ve heard from my Republican friends and so many others is China’s on the rise and America is falling behind. \\n\\nThey’ve got it backward. \\n\\nAmerica is rising. \\n\\nWe have the best economy in the world. \\n\\nSince I’ve come to office, our GDP is up. \\n\\nAnd our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade. \\n\\nWe’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. \\n\\nAnd standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. \\n\\nI’ve revitalized our partnerships and alliances in the Pacific. \\n\\nI’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China’s weapons. \\n\\nFrankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do that. \\n\\nWe want competition with China, but not conflict.  \\n\\nAnd we’re in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against China or anyone else for that matter. \\n\\nHere at home I’ve signed over 400 bipartisan bills.  \\n\\nBut there’s more to do to pass my Unity Agenda. \\n\\nStrengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking. \\n\\nPass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online. \\n\\nHarness the promise of A.I. and protect us from its peril.  \\n\\nBan A.I. voice impersonation and more! \\n\\nAnd keep our one truly sacred obligation, to train and equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home, and when they don’t.  \\n\\nThat’s why I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever, helping millions of veterans who were exposed to toxins and who now are battling more than 100 cancers. \\n\\nMany of them didn’t come home. \\n\\nWe owe them and their families. \\n\\nAnd we owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H and remind us that we can do big things like end cancer as we know it! \\n\\nLet me close with this. \\n\\nI know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while. \\n\\nAnd when you get to my age certain things become clearer than ever before. \\n\\nI know the American story. \\n\\nAgain and again I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation. \\n\\nBetween those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future. \\n\\nMy lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy. \\n\\nA future based on the core values that have defined America. \\n\\nHonesty. Decency. Dignity. Equality. \\n\\nTo respect everyone. To give everyone a fair shot. To give hate no safe harbor.  \\n\\nNow some other people my age see a different story.  \\n\\nAn American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. \\n\\nThat’s not me. \\n\\nI was born amid World War II when America stood for freedom in the world. \\n\\nI grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware among working people who built this country. \\n\\nI watched in horror as two of my heroes, Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated and their legacies inspired me to pursue a career in service. \\n\\nA public defender, county councilman, elected United States Senator at 29, then Vice President, to our first Black President, now President, with our first woman Vice President. \\n\\nIn my career I’ve been told I’m too young and I’m too old. \\n\\nWhether young or old, I’ve always known what endures. \\n\\nOur North Star. \\n\\nThe very idea of America, that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. \\n\\nWe’ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either. \\n\\nAnd I won’t walk away from it now. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans the issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are it’s how old our ideas are? \\n\\nHate, anger, revenge, retribution are among the oldest of ideas. \\n\\nBut you can’t lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back. \\n\\nTo lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future of what America can and should be. \\n\\nTonight you’ve heard mine. \\n\\nI see a future where we defend democracy not diminish it. \\n\\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect other freedoms not take them away. \\n\\nI see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy finally have to pay their fair share in taxes. \\n\\nI see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. \\n\\nAbove all, I see a future for all Americans! \\n\\nI see a country for all Americans! \\n\\nAnd I will always be a president for all Americans! \\n\\nBecause I believe in America! \\n\\nI believe in you the American people. \\n\\nYou’re the reason I’ve never been more optimistic about our future! \\n\\nSo let’s build that future together! \\n\\nLet’s remember who we are! \\n\\nWe are the United States of America. \\n\\nThere is nothing beyond our capacity when we act together! \\n\\nMay God bless you all. \\n\\nMay God protect our troops.\\n\\n###'"
