# LSTM_Project_

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing an LSTM-based model for time-series (or sequence) tasks. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Notebook structure


## Key steps performed
- Data loading and EDA
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- LSTM model design, training, and validation
- Model evaluation and plotting of results
- Saving trained model and results

## Requirements
Typical packages used in the notebook:

- `from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding,LSTM,Dense`
- `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`
- `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences`
- `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer`
- `import numpy as np`
- `import tensorflow as tf`

## Installation (recommended)
1. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place dataset files into `data/` directory.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `LSTM_Project_.ipynb`.
4. Run cells sequentially.

## Reproducibility & Notes
- Use a GPU for faster training if available.
- Set random seeds (numpy, tensorflow/torch) for reproducible results.
- Training time depends on dataset size and hardware.


## Data
Place your dataset files in the `data/` directory and update paths in the notebook accordingly.
